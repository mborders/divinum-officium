[Hymnus Prima]
v. Já o dia nasceu novamente.
Supliquemos, orando, ao Senhor
que nos guarde do mal neste dia
e por atos vivamos o amor.
_
Ponha freios à língua e a modere,
da discórdia evitando a paixão;
que nos vele o olhar e o defenda
da vaidade e de toda a ilusão.
_
Sejam puros os seres no íntimo,
dominando os instintos do mal.
Evitemos do orgulho o veneno,
moderando o impulso carnal.
_
Para que, no final deste dia,
quando a noite, em seu curso, voltar,
abstinentes e puros, possamos
sua glória e louvores cantar.
_
Louvor e glória ao Pai,
Ao filho seu também,
Ao Espírito Paráclito
Agora e sempre.
Amém.
