Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 1:39-47
Azon időben Mária útnak indult, és a hegyekbe sietett, Júda városába. Zakariás házába tért be és üdvözölte Erzsébetet. És így tovább.

Sermons of St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!In Metaphrast. July.
As soon as our Redeemer was come among us, He went with haste, while as yet He was in His mother's womb, to visit His friend John. And John, in the one womb, becoming conscious of the Presence of Jesus in the other womb, dashed himself impatiently against the narrow walls of his natural prison, as though crying out I see the very Lord who hath given nature her bounds, and I wait not for the due season of my birth. There is no need for me to linger here till nine months are ended, for He That is Eternal is with me I will break out of my dark cell I will proclaim my full knowledge of many wonders. I am the sign. I will show that the Christ is here. I am the trumpet let me peal forth the news that the Son of God is come in the flesh. Let me give my trumpetnote, let me bless my father's tongue, and make it to speak again. Let me give my trumpet-note, let me quicken my mother's womb.

V. Akik hűek, vigadjanak dicsőségükben
R. Ujjongjanak nyugvóhelyükön!
