Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 2:19-23
Azon időben amikor Heródes meghalt, megjelent Egyiptomban álmában Józsefnek az Úr angyala, és így szólt hozzá: Kelj föl, fogd a gyermeket és anyját és menj Izrael földjére. És így tovább.

Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. ii.
From the words, they are dead, (in the Plural), which are used in this passage of the Gospel, we may understand that there were others beside Herod which sought the young Child's life probably the Priests and Scribes. And he (Joseph) arose, and took the young Child and His Mother. It is not written, He took his wife and child, but he took the young Child and His Mother; whence it is clear that the holy Evangelist willeth to imply that Joseph was not the father, but the Guardian of Jesus, not the husband, but the Betrothed of Mary.
