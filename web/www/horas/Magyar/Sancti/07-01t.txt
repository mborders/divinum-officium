Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 1:57-65
Elérkezett Erzsébet szülésének ideje, és fiút szült. Amikor a szomszédok és rokonok meghallották, hogy milyen nagyra méltatta az Úr irgalmában, vele örültek. És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk ii. on Luke i.
 He shall be called John. Elizabeth who had herself prophesied of Christ, could not fail to recognise the Fore-runner of the Lord. It is well added: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name whereby we know that he was named, not as the son of Zacharias, but as the Prophet of God. And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called  but since unbelief had bereft him of voice and hearing, he was not able to answer them by word of mouth, and he asked for a writing-table and wrote, saying His name is John.
