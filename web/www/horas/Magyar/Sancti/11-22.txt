Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 25:1-13
Abban az időben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: A mennyek országa hasonlít a tíz szűzhöz, akik fogták lámpásukat, és a vőlegény elé mentek. És így tovább.

Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!Hom 79 on Matth.
Wherefore doth the Lord set forth this parable under the figure of virgins, and not make it of acceptation for all men? He had spoken great things touching virginity, saying There be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. ~(Matth. xix. 12.) He knew also that virginity is a thing which is held in great honour among men, being indeed a thing higher than nature, as is plain from this, that under the Old Testament even the Patriarchs and Saints did not practise it, and that under the New Testament it is not enjoined by any commandment of necessity; for the Lord did not make it binding, but left it open to the free choice of the faithful. Whence also Paul saith Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, that it is good for a man so to be. But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned, and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. (1 Cor. vii. 25, 26, 28.)
