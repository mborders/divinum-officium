!Matt 2:13-18
Azon időben megjelent Józsefnek álmában az Úr angyala, s ezt mondta neki: „Kelj föl, fogd a gyermeket és anyját, menekülj Egyiptomba, s maradj ott, amíg nem szólok És így tovább.

Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!8th on Matthew.
When Joseph had heard this he was not troubled, neither did he say, This is doubtful, or at least obscure. Thou saidst not long ago, that He shall save His people, and now apparently Himself He cannot save; but we are to flee, and journey far, and dwell in a strange land. thy works belie thy words. But Joseph said none of these things, for he was faithful; neither did he curiously ask of the angel the time of his return, which God was not pleased to show him, but only to send him that word, Be thou there until I bring thee word.
