Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 2:1-12
Amikor a júdeai Betlehemben Heródes király idejében Jézus megszületett, bölcsek jöttek napkeletről Jeruzsálembe és kérdezősködtek: „Hol van a zsidók újszülött királya?  És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Book ii. on Luke ii.
What are the gifts of the faithful and true? Gold to our King, frankincense to our God, and myrrh to Him Who died for us. The first is that whereof are made the royal honours of kings, the second is that mystic offering which is used in the worship of the Divine Power, and the third is that wherewith we pay respect to the dead, whose bodies it keepeth from corruption. My brethren, let us who hear and read these things, make offering out of what treasures we have albeit we have it in earthen vessels. (2 Cor. iv. 7.) If we confess that all that we have, we have, not from ourselves, but from Christ, how much more should we confess that whatever we have is not our own, but Christ's?
