Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 2:42-52
Amikor Jézus tizenkét éves lett, szintén fölmentek, az ünnepi szokás szerint. Az ünnepnapok elteltével hazafelé indultak. A gyermek Jézus azonban Jeruzsálemben maradt És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
We read that when He was twelve years old the Lord began to dispute. The number of His years was the same as the number of the Apostles whom He afterwards sent forth to preach the Faith. He Who, as touching His Manhood, was filled with wisdom and grace from God, was not careless of the parents of the same Manhood, and, after three days, was pleased to be found in the Temple thereby foreshadowing that, after the three days of His victorious Passion, He That had been reckoned with the dead, would present Himself, living, to our faith, in His heavenly Kingship and Divine Majesty.
