Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 18:1-10
 Abban az időben odamentek Jézushoz a tanítványok és megkérdezték tőle: „Ki a legnagyobb a mennyek országában?” És így tovább.

Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iii. Comm. on Matth. xviii.
After the finding of the piece of money in the fish's mouth, after the payment of the tribute, what meaneth this sudden question of the Apostles? Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? They had seen that the same tribute-money was paid for Peter as for the Lord, and from this equality of reckoning they gathered that Peter was Prince of all the Apostles, seeing that he had been appraised at the same price as his Master. Therefore they ask, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, and understanding wherefore they erred, is fain to take away the desire of glory by the love of lowliness.
