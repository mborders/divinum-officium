!Luke 15:1-5
Azon az időben a vámosok és a bűnösök mind jöttek, hogy hallgassák Jézust. És így tovább.

Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!34th on the Gospels.
Ye have heard, my brethren, from the Gospel which hath but now been read, how that the publicans and sinners drew near unto our Redeemer, and how that He received them, not only to converse, but also to eat with Him. And when the Pharisees and Scribes saw it, they murmured. From this learn ye, that true righteousness is merciful, and false righteousness is contemptuous, albeit that the righteous also oft-times feel moved with just indignation at sinners. But it is one thing to feel thus indignant through pride, and another to feel so through love of law.
