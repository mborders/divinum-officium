Evangélium szent Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 13:6-17
Azon idoben Jézus példabeszédet mondott a tömegnek: Egy embernek a szőlejében volt egy fügefa. Kiment, gyümölcsöt keresett rajta, de nem talált. És így tovább.

Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!31st on the Gospels.
Our Lord and Redeemer speaketh unto us sometimes by words, and sometimes by deeds, sometimes one thing by words, and another by deeds, and sometimes the same thing both by word and deed. In the portion of the Gospel which hath this day been read, ye have heard, my brethren, two things, the parable of the fig-tree and the history of the woman which was bowed together. In both is a manifestation of the Lord's mercy, but in the one by a parable, in the other by an example. But the barren figtree signifieth the same thing as doth the woman bowed together, and the patience shown to the fig-tree the same thing as doth the healing of the woman bowed together.
