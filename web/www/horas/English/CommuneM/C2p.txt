[Lectio1]
From the Book of Wisdom
!Sap 5:1-4
1 The just shall stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours.
2 These seeing it, shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected salvation.
3 Saying within themselves, repenting, and groaning for anguish of spirit: These are they, whom we had some time in derision, and for a parable of reproach.
4 We fools esteemed their life madness, and their end without honour.

[Lectio2]
!Sap 5:5-7;14
5 Behold how they are numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the saints.
6 Therefore we have erred from the way of truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun of understanding hath not risen upon us.
7 We wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction, and have walked through hard ways, but the way of the Lord we have not known.
14 Such things as these the sinners said in hell:

[Lectio3]
!Sap 5:16-17
16 But the just shall live for evermore: and their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them with the most High.
17 Therefore shall they receive a kingdom of glory, and a crown of beauty at the hand of the Lord: for with his right hand he will cover them, and with his holy arm he will defend them.

[Lectio4]
!Sap 5:18-21
18 And his zeal will take armour, and he will arm the creature for the revenge of his enemies.
19 He will put on justice as a breastplate, and will take true judgment instead of a helmet.
20 He will take equity for an invincible shield:
21 And he will sharpen his severe wrath for a spear, and the whole world shall fight with him against the unwise.

[Responsory8]
R. The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and praised shall be
* All ye right of heart, allelúja, allelúja.
V. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just. And glory,
R. All ye right of heart, allelúja, allelúja.
