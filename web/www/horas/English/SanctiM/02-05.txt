Agatha, having gone into prison, * was blessing the Lord Jesus Christ;;86
My mind * has been strengthened, and has been established by Christ.;;95

[Ant Matutinum 3N]
When the Blessed Agatha * came into the prison, she stretched forth her hands to God, and said: O Lord, Who hast made me overcome the cruelty of the executioners * May it please Thee that I should attain unto thy mercy.
