[Oratio]
O God, Who hast appointed thine Only-begotten Son to be the Saviour of mankind, and hast commanded that His Name should be called Jesus, mercifully grant that we who here on earth do worship that most Holy Name may be made glad in heaven by His Presence.
$Per eumdem

[Ant 3]
Thou shalt call His Name Jesus, * for He shall save His people from their sins, alleluia.
