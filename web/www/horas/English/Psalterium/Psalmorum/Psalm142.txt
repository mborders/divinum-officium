142:1 Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in thy truth: * hear me in thy justice.
142:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: * for in thy sight no man living shall be justified.
142:3a For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: * he hath brought down my life to the earth.
142:3b He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old: * (4) and my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is troubled.
142:5 I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: * I meditated upon the works of thy hands.
142:6 I stretched forth my hands to thee: * my soul is as earth without water unto thee.
142:7a Hear me speedily, O Lord: * my spirit hath fainted away.
142:7b Turn not away thy face from me, * lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
142:8a Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; * for in thee have I hoped.
142:8b Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: * for I have lifted up my soul to thee.
142:9 Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled: * (10a) teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.
142:10b Thy good spirit shall lead me into the right land: * (11a) for thy nameâ€™s sake, O Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thy justice.
142:11b Thou wilt bring my soul out of trouble: * (12a) and in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies.
142:12b And thou wilt cut off all them that afflict my soul: * for I am thy servant.
