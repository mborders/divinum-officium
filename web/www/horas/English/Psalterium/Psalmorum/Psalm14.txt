14:1 Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?
14:2 He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:
14:3a He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:
14:3b Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.
14:4a In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:
14:4b He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * (5a) He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:
14:5b He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.
