Cause there to come upon us, O Lord, a grace from the blessed and worthy wrestling of thine holy Martyrs Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, and Apuleius, fanning ever in us the fire of the love of thyself.

[Lectio93]
From the Sermons of St. Augustine, Bishop
!Serm. 47 of the Saints
Dearly beloved brethren, as often as we keep the Feasts of the holy Martyrs, we look to obtain of the Lord, by their intercession, such good things in this life that thereby we, following them, may gain better in that which is to come. For they only do truly keep Holiday on the Feasts of the Martyrs, who follow after the Martyrs' example. These Feasts of the Martyrs are the Martyrs' preaching, whereby to stir us up to imitate what we are not loath to honour.
