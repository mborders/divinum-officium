St. Felicity, Martyr

[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that in calling to mind the victory of thy blessed Martyr Felicity, we may find shelter both for her sake and in her prayers.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
The Lesson is taken from the Sermons of Pope St. Gregory (the Great.)
!3rd Horn, on the Gospels.
That blessed woman Felicity, whose Birth-feast we are keeping today, had as much dread of leaving her seven sons living after her in the flesh, as have carnal-minded mothers of seeing them go dead before them. When she was taken in the strong pains of persecution, she braced up the hearts of her children by bidding them cleave to the Fatherland above, and became their mother for the spiritual, as she had aforetime been for the fleshly life, bringing them forth for God by her exhortation, as she had brought them forth for the world by her body. And shall I not call this woman a Martyr? Nay, more than Martyr. The seven whom she trusted to God were seven children sent before her to death. She suffered first and triumphed last.
