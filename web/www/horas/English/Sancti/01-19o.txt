St. Canute, King and Martyr

[Oratio]
O God, who, for the greater glory of Thy Church, wast pleased to adorn blessed Canute the king with the palm of martyrdom and with glorious miracles: mercifully grant that, walking in the footsteps of him who followed our Lord in His sufferings, we may thereby deserve to attain to eternal joys.
