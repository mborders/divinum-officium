[Lectio93]
This Mark was a Roman, who sat as Pope in the reign of the Emperor Constantine the Great. He ordained that the Bishop of Ostia, by whom the Bishop of Rome is consecrated, should use the Pallium. He built two Churches, one in the city and the other on the Ardeatine Way, which Constantine enlarged and richly gifted. Mark lived as Pope eight months, and was buried in the Cemetery of Balbina.
