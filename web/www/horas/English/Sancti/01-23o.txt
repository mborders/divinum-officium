[Lectio93]
Emerentiana was a Roman maiden, and the foster-sister of the blessed Agnes. While she was still a Catechumen she was inspired by her faith and love to rebuke the fury of the idol-worshippers against the Christians, whereupon a mob assembled, and stoned her so severely that she was only able to drag herself to the grave of holy Agnes, where, while she prayed, she gave up her soul to God, being baptized, not in water, but in her own blood, so freely shed for Christ.
