Lesson from the Gospel of St. Luke
!Luke 5:27-32
At that time, Jesus saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, and He said unto him: Follow me. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan)
!Book v, Comment. on Luke v
There is a mystery in this calling of the publican, whom He biddeth to follow Him, not so much by bodily steps as by change of heart. Hitherto Levi had been making greedy gains from merchandise, cruel riches at the cost of sailors' toils and dangers; but now, at the call of a word, he, who had been plundering other men's goods, leaveth his own. He leaveth that base station, and followeth hard after the Lord with all his heart. And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house. He that welcometh Christ into his home, feasteth upon the excellency of all pleasures.
