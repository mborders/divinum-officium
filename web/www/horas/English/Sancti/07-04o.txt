[Lectio6]
Not brighter is the sky when the sun doth make it all light with his beams, than is the city of Rome darting forth these twin rays of light to the uttermost bounds of the earth. There it is that Paul, there it is that Peter, will rise, and be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. (Thess. iv, 16.) Think, and thrill at the thought, of what Rome will see then, when she beholdeth Paul and Peter rising suddenly out of that coffin, to be caught up to meet the Lord. What rose will Rome offer to Christ? What twin crowns are they wherewith that city is adorned withal? What fresh springs hath she in her? Therefore it is that I marvel at that city, not because of the abundance of her gold, not because of her pillars, not because of any other loveliness that she hath, but because of these two pillars of the Church. Would that I could even now embrace the corpse of Paul that I could cling to his grave that I could see the dust of that body, which filled up those things that were behind of the sufferings of Christ (Col. i, 24,) which bore about in it the marks of the Lord Jesus (Gal. vi, 17) and which went everywhere carrying the seed of the Gospel
