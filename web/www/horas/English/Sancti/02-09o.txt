[Lectio93]
Apollonia was an aged virgin of Alexandria, who, (in the year of salvation 249,) in the reign of the Emperor Decius, was brought before the idols to worship them, but refused, declaring that Christ Jesus is True God, and that to Him worship is due. The cruel executioners beat and pulled out all her teeth, and threatened to burn her alive if she would not deny Christ. To whom she answered, that for Christ Jesus' sake she was ready to die. Being taken to the place of execution she stood for a few moments as if in doubt, and then, the fire of the Holy Ghost burning up in her heart, she broke from those that held her, and leapt of her own accord into the flames. Her body was quickly consumed, and her soul departed pure to obtain the eternal crown of martyrdom.
