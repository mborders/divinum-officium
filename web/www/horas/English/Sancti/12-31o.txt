On the advice of the doctors, this emperor ordered a bath to be prepared from the blood of children to cure leprosy. The holy apostles Peter and Paul quietly appeared and ordered him to refrain from doing so if he wanted to be freed from leprosy. He was to give up the cruelty of the godless bath and seek out Silvester, who was hiding on Mount Soractus. From there, revitalised by the salutary bath of baptism, he wanted to order temples to be built in the Christian style throughout the Roman Empire, the idols of empty gods to be removed and the true God to be worshipped. Therefore Constantine, obeying the heavenly admonitions, calls Silvester the eagerly sought after one: From him he recognises the images of the apostles, is healed through baptism and burns to defend and spread the religion of Christ.
