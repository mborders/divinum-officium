Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:7-12
Brethren: The things that were gain to me, these, for the sake of Christ, I have counted loss. Nay more, I count everything loss because of the excelling knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord. For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I count them as dung that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a justice of my own, which is from the Law, but that which is from faith in Christ, the justice from God based upon faith; so that I may know Him and the power of His Resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings: become like to Him in death, in the hope that somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this, or already have been made perfect, but I press on hoping that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has laid hold of me.

[Graduale]
!Ps 91:13-14
The just man shall flourish like the palm tree, like a cedar of Lebanon shall he grow in the house of the Lord.
!Ps 91:3
V. To proclaim Your kindness at dawn and Your faithfulness throughout the night. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Osee 14:6
V. The just man shall blossom like the lily, and flourish forever before the Lord. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 11:25-30
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to little ones. Yes, Father, for such was Your good pleasure. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden light.
