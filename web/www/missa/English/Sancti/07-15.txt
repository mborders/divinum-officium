[Oratio]
O God, Who on this day took St. Henry, Your Confessor, to the everlasting kingdom from the throne of an earthly empire; we humbly beseech You, that as You enabled him, protected by the abundance of Your grace, to overcome the temptations of the world, so grant that we, in emulation of him, may shun the allurements of this world and come to You with pure hearts.
