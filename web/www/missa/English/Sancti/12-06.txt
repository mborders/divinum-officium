Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 13:7-17
Brethren: Remember your superiors, who spoke to you the word of God. Consider how they ended their lives, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday and today, yes, and forever. Do not be led away by various and strange doctrines. For it is good to make steadfast the heart by grace, not by foods, in which those who walked found no profit. We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle. For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holies by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp; and so Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people by His Blood, suffered outside the gate. Let us therefore go forth to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach; for here we have no permanent city, but we seek for the city that is to come. Through Him, therefore, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, fruit of lips praising His name. And do not forget kindness and charity, for by such sacrifices Godâ€™s favor is obtained. Obey your superiors and be subject to them, for they keep watch as having to render an account of your souls.

!Ps 88:21-23
I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him, that My hand may be always with him, and that My arm may make him strong.
V. No enemy shall deceive him, nor shall the wicked afflict him. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 91:13
The just man shall flourish like the palm tree, like a cedar of Lebanon shall he grow. Alleluia.
