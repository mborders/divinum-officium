Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 8:18-23
Brethren: I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that will be revealed in us. For the eager longing of creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God. For creation was made subject to vanity - not by its own will but by reason of Him Who made it subject - in hope, because creation itself also will be delivered from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God. For we know that all creation groans and travails in pain until now. And not only it, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit - we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption as sons of God, the redemption of our body, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 78:10, 2
Avenge, O Lord, the shedding of Your servantsâ€™ blood.
V. They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of heaven, the flesh of Your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 115:15
V. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His faithful ones. Alleluia.

[Offertorium]
