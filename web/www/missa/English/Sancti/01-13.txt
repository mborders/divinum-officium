O God, Whose only-begotten Son appeared in the substance of our flesh, grant, we pray You, that we who acknowledge His outward likeness to us may deserve to be inwardly refashioned in His image.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 1:29-34
At that time, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he said, Behold, the Lamb of God, Who takes away the sin of the world! This is He of Whom I said, ‘After me there comes One Who has been set above me, because He was before me.’ And I did not know Him. But that He may be known to Israel, for this reason have I come baptizing with water. And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon Him. And I did not know Him. But He Who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He upon Whom you will see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon Him, He it is Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.

We bring You offerings, O Lord, for the epiphany of Your Son, Who has been born, humbly beseeching You that, as He is the creator of our gifts, so also He may mercifully receive them, our Lord Jesus Christ.
