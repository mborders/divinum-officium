Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Eccli 44:10-15
These were godly men whose virtues have not been forgotten; their wealth remains in their families, their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed has stood in the covenants. And their children for their sakes remain forever; their seed and their glory shall not be forsaken. All these are buried in peace, but their name lives on and on. At gatherings their wisdom is retold and the assembly sings their praises.

[Graduale]
!Ps 132:1-2
Behold, how good it is, and how pleasant, where brethren dwell as one! It is as when the precious ointment upon the head runs down over the beard, the beard of Aaron. Alleluia, alleluia. 
V. This is the true fraternal love, which conquers the wickedness of the world: holding fast to the glory of the heavenly kingdom, it has followed Christ. Alleluia.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 5:12-13
All who love Your name shall glory in You, for You, O Lord, bless the just man; O Lord, You surround us with the shield of your good will.

[Secreta]
O Lord, graciously accept, through the merits of Your holy Martyrs John and Paul, the sacrificial gifts dedicated to You, and grant they may prove to be for us a lasting help.

[Postcommunio]
