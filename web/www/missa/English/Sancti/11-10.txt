[Oratio]
O God, by his difficult vow to make daily progress in holiness, You placed in the heart of blessed Andrew, Your Confessor, a wondrous longing to ascend unto You; grant us, by his merits and intercession, so to become sharers of that same grace that, ever pursuing the more perfect things, we may be happily brought unto the height of Your glory.
