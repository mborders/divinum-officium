[Oratio]
God, Who didst vouchsafe to enkindle in blessed Fidelis the fire of thy Seraphim, and to glorify his toil to give men a true knowledge of thee by the palm-branch of martyrdom and by great signs and wonders, be entreated, we beseech thee, for his sake and by his prayers, and so establish us in the knowledge and love of thee, that we also, like him, may be found faithful even unto death in serving of thee. 
$Per Dominum.
