[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:3-13
At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when are these things to happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the world? And in answer Jesus said to them, Take care that no one leads you astray. For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. For you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. Take care that you do not be alarmed, for these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be pestilences and famines and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginnings of sorrows. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and will hate one another. And many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. And because iniquity will abound, the charity of the many will grow cold. But whoever perseveres to the end, he shall be saved.

[Secreta]
Be appeased by the gifts we offer You, O Lord, and through the intercession of Your holy Martyrs Januarius and companions, safeguard us from all dangers.
