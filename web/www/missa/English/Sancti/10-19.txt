O God, Who graciously made blessed Peter, Your Confessor, glorious by the gift of remarkable penance and sublime contemplation, grant, we beseech You, that, by the merit of his prayers, we may the more easily understand the things of heaven by curbing our passions.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:7-12
Brethren: The things that were gain to me, these, for the sake of Christ, I have counted loss. Nay more, I count everything loss because of the excelling knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord. For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I count them as dung that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a justice of my own, which is from the Law, but that which is from faith in Christ, the justice from God based upon faith; so that I may know Him and the power of His Resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings: become like to Him in death, in the hope that somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this, or already have been made perfect, but I press on hoping that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has laid hold of me.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 12:32-34
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Do not be afraid, little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom. Sell what you have and give alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure unfailing in heaven, where neither thief draws near nor moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.

[Postcommunio]
We pray You, almighty God, that we who have received heavenly nourishment may thereby, through the intercession of blessed Peter, Your Confessor, be sustained against all harm and danger.
