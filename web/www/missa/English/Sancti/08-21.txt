[Oratio]
Almighty and merciful God, Who endowed St. Jane Frances, burning with love of You, with a wondrous strength of spirit through all the paths of life in the way of perfection, and willed through her to ennoble Your Church by a new religious family; grant by her merits and prayers, that we who are aware of our weakness, may trust firmly in Your power and, by the assistance of divine grace, overcome all obstacles in our way.

[Secreta]
O Lord, may this sacrificial gift enkindle in us that fire of love which burned so warmly in the heart of St. Jane Frances and consumed it by the flames of everlasting charity.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Pour upon us, O Lord, the spirit of Your love, that You Who have filled us with the strength of heavenly bread, may through the intercession of blessed Jane Frances, make us look upon the things of the world as nought and with pure minds seek You, the only God.
