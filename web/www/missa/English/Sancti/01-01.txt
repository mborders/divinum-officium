Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Titus
!Titus 2:11-15
Beloved: The grace of God our Saviour has appeared to all men, instructing us, in order that, rejecting ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live temperately and justly and piously in this world; looking for the blessed hope and glorious coming of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and cleanse for Himself an acceptable people, pursuing good works. Thus speak, and exhort, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 97: 3, 4, 2
All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our God. Sing joyfully to God, all you lands. 
V. The Lord has made His salvation known: in the sight of the nations He has revealed His justice. Alleluia, alleluia. 
!Heb 1:1-2
V. God, Who in diverse ways spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets; last of all, in these days, has spoken to us by His Son. Alleluia.
