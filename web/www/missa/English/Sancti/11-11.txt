[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 11:33-36
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or even under the measure, but upon the lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light. The lamp of your body is your eye. If your eye be sound, your whole body will be full of light. But if it be evil, your body also will be full of darkness. Take care, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness. If, then, your whole body is full of light, having no part in darkness, it will all be illumined, as when a bright lamp illumines you.
