[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 24:23-31
I bud forth delights like the vine, my blossoms become fruit fair and rich. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope. In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue. Come to me, all you that yearn for me, and be filled with my fruits; for my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance better to have than honey and the honeycomb. My memory is to everlasting generations. They who eat of me will hunger still, and they who drink of me will thirst for more. He who obeys me will not be put to shame, they who serve me will never fail. They who explain me shall have life everlasting.

[Graduale]
O Virgin Mary, blessed and venerable art thou: who without blemish to thy maidenhood, didst become the Mother of the Savior.
V. O Virgin Mother of God, He whom the whole world cannot contain, enclosed Himself within thy womb, and became man.
V. Joyful art thou, holy Virgin Mary, and worthy of all praise: for of thee hast risen the Son of Justice, Christ our Lord.
_
Alleluia, alleluia.
Through thee, O Mother of God, has the life we had lost been
restored: from heaven didst thou beget thy Child, to the world brought forth a Savior. Alleluia.
