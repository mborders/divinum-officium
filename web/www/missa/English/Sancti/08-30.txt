Almighty God, Giver of all good things, Who willed that blessed Rose, imbued in early life with the dew of heavenly grace, should bloom among the Indians with the beauty of virginity and patience, grant unto us, Your servants, that, following the fragrance of her sweetness, we may be found worthy to become a sweet savor of Christ.
