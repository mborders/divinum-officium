Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Eccles. 24:11-13, 15-20
In all things, I sought rest and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord. Then the Creator of all things commanded, and said to me; and He that made me rested in my tabernacle. And He said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob and thine inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect. And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem: and I took root in an honorable people, and in the portion of my God His inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of Saints. I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on Mount Sion: I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted. I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aromatic balm: I yielded a sweet odor like the best myrrh.

May the prayer of the Mother of God aid Thy people, O Lord: and although we know her to have passed out of this life, fulfilling the lot of the flesh, may we experience her intercession for us with Thee in Heavenly glory.
