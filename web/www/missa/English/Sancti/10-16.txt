[Oratio]
O God, Who taught blessed Hedwig to forsake worldly vanities that she might with her whole heart humbly follow Your cross, grant that, through her merits and example, we may learn to renounce the perishable delights of the world and, by embracing Your cross, overcome all things opposed to us.
