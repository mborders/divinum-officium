O God, shepherd and ruler of all the faithful, look with favor upon Your servant N.p, whom You willed to designate shepherd of Your Church; grant him, we beseech You, that by word and example he may so benefit those in his charge, that together with the flock committed to his care, he may attain life everlasting.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 1:1-7
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, chosen unto the sanctification of the Spirit according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto obedience to Jesus Christ and the sprinkling of His blood: grace and peace be given you in abundance. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who according to His great mercy has begotten us again, through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto a living hope, unto an incorruptible inheritance - undefiled and unfading, reserved for you in heaven. By the power of God you are guarded through faith for salvation, which is ready to be revealed in the last time. Over this you rejoice; though now for a little while, if need be, you are made sorrowful by various trials, that the temper of your faith - more precious by far than gold which is tried by fire - may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ our Lord.
